Details at https://www.facebook.com/groups/1928749080691736/,"This tourney is part of an ongoing celebration of the 800th anniversary of The Marshall’s death in 2019. Fought in the style of the 12th-century ransom tourneys of France, teams of fighters in armor, appropriate from 1000-1250 AD, will fight to gain ransom and glory. Detailed rules will be posted at https://www.facebook.com/groups/1928749080691736/ 

All SCA authorization, armor and weapons standards apply to the tournament.
All combatants must conform to the weapon and armor standards of the tournament. 
The tournament will consist of three rounds of melée, 15 minutes each, with a 5 minute break between to hydrate or settle ransoms. 
Dress:
1) No visible plastic, including and not limited to baskets hilts. 
2) No visible sneakers or modern footwear (i.e., Crocs).
3) Armor should be from 1000-1250. Surcoats highly recommended.
4) Middle Eastern and European armor only. No Japanese, Chinese, etc.
Weapon restrictions: 
1) No flamboyant duct tape (i.e., Hello Kitty duct tape).
2) Pole arms must be six feet or under, and must have a head or a proper profile (subject to approval), i.e., no unpadded pole arms.
3) Shields must be painted, heraldry recommended. (Don't take this as a personal challenge; this is also subject to approval.) 
4) Spears, daggers, axes, maces and greatswords are welcome. No madus permitted.
Combat and Ransom:
All normal SCA combat rules apply. Example: telling blow to limbs loss of the limb.
TEAMS: To be chosen at the beginning of the tournament. We will attempt to make the sides even and fair, as well as attempt to keep whole units together. Changing of sides is permitted.

RANSOMING: Once killed, combatant takes a knee, and counts to 30, (This does not have to be out loud.) , and:
1) is escorted by opposing team to the Resurrection point for ransom. 
Or:
2) Time runs out and they return to their own resurrection point to resurrect.
3) Closed face helmet ignore face thrusts.

How the Ransom works:
There will be two people on either side to record the Ransoms. Suggested ransom is an item between $5 - $20 in value and should be fitting of one's station. The terms must be agreed upon by both parties. 
Eleanor of  Aquitaine Clause: A member of the gallery can provide Ransom and is encouraged to do so, especially if they deem the combatant worthy.",2.0,"",,,,,1,2018-05-06 19:18:00 UTC,Battlefield
6283,Blue List,2017-08-04 09:00:00 UTC,2017-08-04 12:00:00 UTC,Sir Stefan Ulfkelsson,æthelmearc,9078,Pennsic Day of Deeds: The Viking Raid Part 1,Martial Activities,Other,,true,"A heavy fighting raid scenario with additional authenticity rules for armor, weapons, clothing and a loot requirement for admittance. Join the Raid!","Based upon several other Wars and their historically based fighting scenarios, this one will have three components to get more people involved. This is Part 1 which is the Heavy Battle/Raid. This will be based upon a fictional raid of a group of Eastern Norse personas (Scandinavian, Icelandic, Irish, etc.) against Western Norse personas (Varangian and Rus) at a trading center during the 9th to 11th centuries. Authenticity/admittance rules will also be provided in advance by Facebook group ""Pennsic Day of Deeds"" and questions may be asked there as well.  The scenario will be fought five times, taking turns being defenders and attackers The last one will be by flip of a coin to determine who attacks/defends. Based upon attire, teams will be determined. Lamellar is strictly Western; chainmail can be either side depending upon under-clothing, and soft kits (clothing only with hidden armor) will also be determined by marshals. Sides will be made as even as possible in order to make strategy and prowess rule the day. Kit and weapons inspection will begin at 9 am sharp with sides determined during inspections. Each side will  select its own *Jarl* who will lead the battle to follow. After each battle the Band can choose to keep the leader or select a new one. Candidates who wish to be *Jarl* will have a brief time to say why they should be a *Jarl* themselves, or they may use a Skald to support themselves. They may use bribery to secure the position. In order to be a participant in the battle each person **must** bring a piece of loot to be given to the winning team at the end of the battles and then distributed by the final winning *Jarl*. Additional loot/largess is strongly encouraged for great acts of bravery, prowess, for water bearers, marshals, etc. After this, there will be a brief break and a second area (Runestone Hill) will be available as a mock trading center. Spectators are asked to wear their finest garb, ideally of a Norse or Norse-related group. Another inspection will be required for entry into this phase. Please see Pennsic Day of Deeds: The Trading Center for details on this scenario.  

Kit Inspection: The three primary marshals will have final say in admittance. if questions arise, contact Stefan Ulfkelsson (Facebook name the same) in advance. Kits not meeting criteria will not be allowed on the field.  

Combat Conventions: The battle will use standard SCA-blow acknowledgement with the following additions:
     1. All combatants are considered to be fully engaged at all times. Remember, this will likely be a small melee
     2. **Controlled** body contact is permitted. Any over-zealous misuse of this is grounds for immediate removal from the battle at the marshals' discretion. We are **not** encouraging injuries; we are allowing a more period-looking battle.  
     3. If your weapon is dropped, you may attempt to recover it, draw a secondary weapon if you have one, yield or run. You are not helpless unless you determine you are!
     4. Fighters knocked to the ground may be ""pinned"" by a spear by applying firm pressure (**not** repeated blows; just firm pressure) with the spear's tip. Warriors pinned are dead regardless of armor worn.
     5. Strikes to the leg will render the fighter incapacitated.  
     6. Thrusts to the leg will allow the fighter to fight from a kneeling position only.  
     7. Shields may be used passively (slung over the back in a period manner) and may provide proof from blows as if armored.
     8. Striking with shields, hafts or weapon guards is **not** permitted and may result in immediate removal from the battle at the marshals' discretion.
     9. Intentionally tripping an opponent by body part, armor or weapon is not permitted. 

Armored Areas:  
     ---Warriors may accept 2 strikes in rapid succession to the top of the helm before death.
     ---The top of the helm is considered proof against a thrust.
     ---Warriors may accept 2 strikes in rapid succession to areas covered by chain mail before death.
     ---Chain mail is considered proof against thrust from a single-handed weapon.
     ---Chain mail is considered proof against thrust from a two handed axe.
     ---Chain mail is **not** considered proof against thrust from spears.

Danish Axes (two-handed axes):
     ---Danish axes require only one strike to kill through helms.
     ---Danish axes require only one strike to kill through chain mail.  
     ---Three quickly repeated blows with a Danish axe to a shield destroys the shield, and the opponent must immediately drop the shield. This applies to passively slung shields as well.  

Kit Requirements:

Basic Appearance:  
     ---Fabrics should be of wool, linen, silk or suitable look-a-likes.  Blatantly modern fabrics will **not** be allowed.
     ---Colors must be appropriate for un-dyed wool or material dyed with natural dyes (no harsh modern colors).  
     ---Clothing must contain no visible modern features including symbols/logos, zippers or other modern fasteners.
     ---No visible plastics or other blatantly modern materials. 

Clothing:
     ---The combatants should have both over- and under-kyrtles for either Eastern/Western, or under-kyrtle and caftan if Western.  Worn with an over-belt(s) or girdle and have appropriate neck closure/design. It may have side slits.  
     ---Pants should be worn and must cover all necessary safety gear (unless splinted over armor of a Varangian style is chosen) for SCA minimum requirements.
     ---Serviceable leg bindings/wrappings/*puttees*/*winingas* are highly encouraged.
     ---Footwear should be of low ankle boot or shoe style and either turn-shoe construction or a suitable turn-shoe look-a-like.  Extra thick soles and/or studs are permissible but covering a modern shoe with a spat (leather covering) is **not** permitted.  

Weapons:
     ---All weapons must meet SCA safety requirements.
     ---No basket hilts are permitted of any material. Swords and *saexes* should have a period appropriate cross hilt. Further, the must be single-handed and must not exceed 40 inches.
     ---Single-handed axes may not exceed 3 feet in total length.
     ---Spears may not exceed 7 and 1/2 feet in total length and should be clearly recognizable as a Norse-era spear (have a defined shape, not just tape on the rattan).  
     ---Danish axes may not exceed 6 feet and should be clearly recognizable as a Norse-era Danish axe (have a defined head, not just tape on the rattan).  
     ---Spears **must** be carried by all warriors unless they carry a Danish axe.  
     ---All warriors must carry at least one other weapon (sword, saex or axe).  
     ---Warriors carrying a sword should be of higher status, and their kit should reflect that status (mail shirt or lamellar and finer belt fittings and accessories).  

Armor:
     ---All armor must meet SCA safety requirements.
     ---Helms should be of a variety appropriate to the persona and period reflected by the kit and requirements of the Battle. No visible spun tops are permitted. Helms should have a leather or chain mail drape covering the sides and neck unless the style is appropriate without one. Be prepared to explain why you don't have this.  
     ---SCA-legal body and limb armor is to be hidden under clothing and **not** be visible in normal motion. Two exceptions: chainmail armor and gauntlets to the previous statement.
     ---Gauntlets must be worn. They should be made to look not glaringly modern. (Plastic will be accepted but covering it will go a long way to making everyone happy!)  
     ---Gorgets are required and hiding them as best as possible is strongly encouraged. 
     ---Exposed bar grills are acceptable but covering them with chain drapes looks better. We will live with bar grills if we have to!
     ---Lamellar is acceptable but will immediately move you to the Western side. This is a high-status item and should be reflected in higher-status items in the rest of your kit. Also, your loot should be of high status as well. Good kit=good loot, so don't scrimp!  

 Shield:  
     ---A round shield with a domed boss with a single-hand grip and no arm straps is acceptable. The round shield may be flat or lenticular. A kite or elongated heater is also acceptable but will relegate the bearer to the Western side and the rest of the combatant's kit should reflect that as well. Whichever shield style is chosen it must be trimmed/edged in rawhide or leather. **No** foam, carpet or obviously modern components are allowed. Shields may be of metal or wood but if metal, **please** make an effort to hide the shiny metal on the back side. Simple flat black spray paint can go a long way. We would love to see all wooden shields and likely in the future they will be!    

Additional Kit Suggestions (things that will help set your kit and status apart from others):
     ---Embroidery or tablet-woven trim on kyrtles and caftans.
     ---Jewelry (decorative or functional) of a type appropriate to the persona and time frame being represented. May include equal-arm crosses, disc brooches, etc.
     ---Decorative whetstones.
     ---A belt or belts with decorative plates.
     ---A Birka-style, *Tarsoly*- or *Sabertache*-style belt pouch.
     ---A banner of arms to display. (Weathervane-style looks great, in my opinion!). 
     ---A cloak of rectangular shape with or without embroidery. (Does not have to be fought in unless you want to.)
     ---*Winingas, puttees, wickelbander*, etc., with garter hooks and possibly with decorative over-wrapping of tablet-woven design.

A final word: The intent of these guidelines/rules is to provide as immersive an event as we can within the SCA framework. It is not to encourage ""rules lawyering"", and that can result in your expulsion from the battle. We want this to be fun and an epic thing for both participants and spectators to enjoy and make the Society proud. You chose to be here voluntarily so be the shining example of what you can be so others want/wish they were you. Be the Hero of Legend! This is the first attempt at this style, to our knowledge, at Pennsic. In future years, the guidelines may become more strict, so please stay tuned! 

Thanks to whoever wrote the rules for the Gulf Wars Viking Raid upon which these rules are based! I owe you a beer or a mead or something so look me up! Stefan Ulfkelsson Aethelmearc-KSCA, OL

Both light and very portable, its use continued in isolated areas of Europe (especially Italy) until modern times. When used with copies of archaeological finds, these removable whorl spindles produce a very delicate ""laceweight"" yarn, suitable for warp. These techniques were in use at least from 150 CE until 800 CE in Europe. We will learn the special way of dressing these small distaves for hot countries.

Students in hands-on section of class can either purchase a distaff, spindle and wool kit, bring their own spindles and distaves, or ask for a loaner kit. **Note:** Students **do not** have to participate in kit purchases, and are welcome to simply observe.

*Okeiko* means ""honorable practice"". This is a multi-part workshop intended for beginners who wish to learn how to participate in tea gatherings. Both the role of the guest and the role of the host will be introduced. You will learn something new in each workshop. We will begin with walking and bowing and progress to the rudiments of preparing and consuming a bowl of *matcha*. Limited materials will be available for student use during the workshop. 

If you are interested in purchasing materials for long-term personal use, then you should acquire a guest kit and a *fukusa*: 
A guest kit for men can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/guest-starter-kit-man339.html

A *fukusa* for men can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/fumepunu9si.html
A *fukusa* for women can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/fuworenu9si.html
While it is possible to save money by ordering directly from Japan, doing so requires dealing with Japanese online storefronts. A note about *fukusa*. A number #9 *fukusa* is much easier to manipulate than *fukusa* with lower numbers. Paying extra is worth the price. A *fukusa* and a fan are what  you need to practice during class. I have an extremely limited number of loaner *fukusa*. You can substitute a number of items  for a fan. Please read the online descriptions of the fans carefully if you choose to provide a substitute or acquire a fan from another source.

There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html (Yes, they really are that expensive.) I will try to pick up a couple of loaners (I currently have one) between now and Pennsic.

There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html (Yes, they really are that expensive.) I will try to pick up a couple of loaners (I currently have one) between now and Pennsic.

King Dietrich and Queen Una, gracious Monarchs of Atlantia, extend an invitation to the children of the Knowne World to attend the Twentieth Annual Knowne World Children’s Fête at Pennsic XLVII.

The Fête will take place in The Great Hall on Wednesday, August 8, 2018, from 10 am until 1 pm. This event is designed for children ages four and older.

In keeping with previous years, the morning will be filled with a variety of arts and crafts, ongoing activities and live performances to amuse and delight. We may have some activities that involve water, so please make sure your young ones are dressed appropriately. There will be a light snack and drinks available for children and their parents.

Parents and Guardians, please note that you must remain with your child at the Fête. Due to the large numbers of children that attend, organizers cannot be responsible for food allergies or other health issues. We ask that children do not bring personal articles with them, as the organizers will not be responsible for lost, broken or stolen items and sad faces.
 
Volunteers Needed: Volunteers are always needed for the Fête! We have need of gentles that want to sponsor their own activity or help with activities that need additional people. Gentles are needed to set up and help clean up and also to provide general help (i.e., signing in children, relief staff, etc.). We can never have too many people helping. We ask that volunteers be at The Great Hall at 9 am for set up, and clean up should be done by 2 pm. Please consider giving your time to ensure the children have a magnificent time! We request that you wear something pink to honor the Fête’s founder, Duchess Arielle of Atlantia.

If you would like to help or need additional information, contact Lady Jacintha, camping with Finis Terra in B09, at the corner of Too Damn Far Road and Ledevoe Poboische. This will surely be another fun-filled, festive occasion for the children of the Knowne World. Please remember that without the generous volunteers who give of their time and energy each year, the party would not happen.
If you would like to help with the Known World Children's Fête at Pennsic, please take a few moments to give us your information.

Holds: All holds are local. Clock runs during any hold except medical. No time checks are given. 
Field: 120 yards x 120 yards. Buildings are 30’ x 30’. Fighters consist of authorized combat archers and no more than 30 shield men per side. There will be 5 buildings on the field, with 2 doorways (5’ openings) each.  
Scenario: The two sides will defend and hold the buildings until the clock runs out or last man standing. In addition to bolts and arrows, any fighter may use SCA-legal heavy thrown weapons for throwing only. Please allow time prior to the first battle for inspection of anything that may require discussion. 
Movement: The buildings on the field are solid. You may not fire through walls. Archers must remember the clear the bow rule at all times. Thrown weapons also require clearing the hand.

Starting state: Fighters must start by touching resurrection point on their own side. 
Resurrection: This battle allows a maximum of 3 resurrections for all combatants.
Gleaning: Tube ammo and thrown weapons may be gleaned and field inspected. 

Siege/CA Combined Battle - 1 Point
Time: Combat continues for 15 minutes, at which time the side holding the most buildings is declared the winner.
Holds: All holds are local. Clock runs during any hold except medical. No time checks are given. 
Field: 120 yards x 120 yards. Buildings are 30’ x 30’. Fighters consist of authorized combat archers, siege engineers, and no more than 30 shields per side. There will be 5 buildings on the field, with 2 doorways (5’ openings) each. Siege engines may not pass the forward line (15 yards off the center) or the back line (edge of the world).
Scenario: The two sides will defend and hold the buildings until the clock runs out or last man standing. In addition to bolts and arrows, any fighter may use SCA-legal heavy thrown weapons for throwing only. Please allow time prior to the first battle for inspection of anything that may require discussion. Only siege fire disables siege engines. Three hits by a siege object will destroy a ballista, six hits destroy a trebuchet. Crews should call out one, two, three… when their siege engine is hit. 
Movement: The buildings on the field are solid. Archers and thrown weapons may not fire through walls. Archers must remember the clear the bow rule at all times. Thrown weapons also require clearing the hand. Siege fire hits through walls.
Victory condition: Control of building is described as a minimum of three fighters from either side occupying the building. If there are multiple numbers of fighters from both sides, the side with the highest count controls the building. 
Starting state: Fighters must start by touching resurrection point on their own side. Engines may be positioned within the forward line (15 yards off the center) and the back line (edge of the world), but crews will begin at the resurrection point.
Resurrection: This battle allows a maximum of 3 resurrections for all combatants. Engines that fall below the minimum crew requirements are considered dead and must be made safe and/or removed from the field. The minimum crew limit is 2 engineers for any Class B engine, 3 engineers for any Class A engine.
Gleaning: Tube ammo and thrown weapons may be gleaned and field inspected. 

Siege Only Battle - **No shields or pavises** - 1 Point
Time: Combat continues until a side eliminates all engines and targets or 20 minutes, whichever comes first. 
Holds: All holds are local. Clock **runs** during any hold except medical. No time checks are given.
Field: 120 yards x 120 yards. Crews may not pass the forward line (15 yards off the center) or the back line (edge of the world). Targets will be placed by the Siege Marshal in Charge 30 yards off of the center line. Engines and crews must maintain a 5-foot radius from the target. 
Scenario: The opposing sides will attempt to take each other’s engines and targets out with siege fire. The two sides will have a number of targets equal to the number of engines on their side. For example: if Side A fields 9 engines, and Side B fields 7 engines, the marshal will place 9 targets on Side B’s 30 yard line that Side A will attempt to eliminate in addition to the opponent’s engines and 7 targets on Side A’s 30 yard line that Side B will attempt to eliminate in addition to the opponent’s engines. 
Movement: Engines may move and reposition during combat in attempts to evade hits. There will be both a forward line beyond which engines may not advance, and a back line beyond which they may not retreat, unless destroyed. The buildings on the field are combat obstacles and do not interfere with firing. Engines may not be fired while being moved or while in motion, and may only be moved a 'safe' condition (i.e. not ready to fire, or cocked).
Victory condition: Numerical engine and target superiority of one side remaining at 20 mins. Each target must be struck by one siege round to be eliminated. Three hits by a siege object will destroy a ballista, six hits destroy a trebuchet. Crews should call out one, two, three… when their siege engine is hit. If the sides (engine and target total) are equal at the end of 20 mins there is a shootout: The first engine or target hit scored by any engine wins the battle for that side.
Starting state: Siege crews must start behind the back line on the field and may get a running start to their engine. Their engine must be in a ""safe"" condition and may not be ready to fire, or cocked.
No resurrection: This is a **single life only** battle for all combatants. Siege crew members may be struck by siege ammo and are dead. Incoming shots cannot be intentionally blocked by the engine crews. If so, the crew person is dead. Once the battle starts, crews cannot switch engines. When their engine is destroyed, the crew is dead. When the crew falls below the minimum necessary to operate the engine, the engine and remaining crew members are dead. The minimum crew limit is 2 engineers for any Class B engine, 3 engineers for any Class A engine.
Gleaning: Siege ammo may be gleaned by engine crews and field inspected prior to re-firing. 

Final Siege/CA Scenario - 1 Point
No Time Limit
Field - House (30’ x 30’) is the target. Score based on number of rounds dropped by each side into a house. Trebuchets may set up no closer than 40 yards away from the house. Arbalists and other direct fire engines may set up no closer that 60 yards from the house. Combat Archers may set up as follows: Light bows set up at 30’, heavy bows set up at 40’. Crews and archers may move no closer than their minimum distance, but may re-position to improve their accuracy in between shots. Engines may only move in a “safe” position (not cocked).
Scenario - Each side will fire 21 rounds - siege or combat archery. Each side will determine independently who will fire the rounds. A mix of seven siege crews and archers will take turns firing three shots each until 21 have been fired. 
Victory condition - Highest combined number of rounds that fall **inside** the hay bales wins. Rounds that are partially in will only be counted if more than half of the length of the round falls inside the hay bale. Rounds that land in and bounce out will count. Rounds that land out and bounce in do **not** count. The CA and Siege Marshals in charge will keep the official count. If the count is even when all rounds have been fired, Sudden Death rules will be enacted - first shot in the target will win the War Point. First shot in Sudden Death will be determined by coin flip.

There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html (Yes, they really are that expensive.)

No experiences necessary, all voices welcome. Instead of rehearsing for a performance, we will practice for learning's sake and go caroling in the Bog at the end of the series.

(Muster 9:30 am) 
9 points total.
1 battle, fought twice as attack/defend for time.
Fastest combined armored/rapier attack time wins the whole point allotment.
Attackers have unlimited resurrections. Defenders have 2 resurrections for 3 total lives. This is true for both armored and rapier halves.
Side that is currently behind has the option to attack or defend first. If tied, the winner of a coin flip will choose.
Battle is fought in 2 stages, armored and rapier.
Armored victory condition will be transport of a heavy, handled box of “explosives” to a marked “detonation zone” (DZ). East will provide the box.
Box starts behind the initial resurrection line, 300’ from the DZ.
Anyone carrying the box must do so with a gauntleted hand.
Box “explodes” to stop time as soon as any part of the box enters the DZ.
Between the initial resurrection line and the DZ are 5 left/right staggered points every 50’. These can be “flipped” to become additional resurrection points.
Combat archery and siege equipment throughout, armored portion. No gleaning of arrows or siege ammunition allowed.
Once the armored team stops the clock, there will be a 15-minute change-out to rapier.
Rapier battle will be a castle assault. The victory condition is flipping 3 banners within the castle.
There are 3 entry points to the castle: front, left, & right.
Banner 1 is 50’ inside the main door. Banners 2 & 3 are 50’ outside each side entry point.
