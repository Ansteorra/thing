The attacking army will start at the entrance to the mountain pass. The defending army may divide their forces anywhere within the three field segments at the start of the battle. The attacking army will have unlimited resurrections. The defending army will have one life outside the castle and one life inside the castle. When killed outside the castle, a defender should move to the castle. Attacker resurrections will take place at the entrance to the mountain pass. Attacker resurrections will be spontaneous. Once the castle is captured (i.e., the last defender killed), the sides will flip and run the scenario again. The victor in the battle is the side which captures all four zones in the least amount of time. The attacking force must proceed through the mountain pass, then through the town and then through the wall. There will be no time stoppage before proceeding from one field segment to the next. Attackers do not have to kill all defenders in a segment before proceeding to the next field segment. All field segments have to be captured (i.e., all defenders killed) before attacking the castle. After all defenders are killed in the field segments, there will be a 10-minute break before the castle segment begins. Attacking siege weapons may be set up inside the mountain areas. Siege placed in these areas may be targeted by defending siege weapons and may be moved out of these areas as desired. Siege weapons set up in this area may not attack defending troops in the mountain pass. They  may start attacking the town as soon as defending troops in the town are engaged by attacking troops. In the town, attacking siege weapons may move up to the northern edge of the northernmost row of buildings. In the town, combat archers may not fire over the walls of the  buildings but may fire through the doorways. At the wall, combat archers may not fire over the wall but may fire through the openings. Siege may fire over the wall. If destroyed, attacking siege weapons must get a combat inspection before they may resume firing. Defending siege weapons may be placed in the town or behind the wall at the beginning of the battle. If destroyed, they may be moved off of the field into the castle for the castle segment. Gleaning of siege ammo is allowed for both the attackers and defenders. On the castle wall there will be three siege targets. The target on the left will be used for the left side of the castle. The target in the center will be used for the gate. The target on the right will be used for the right side of the castle. The targets must be struck three times to be considered destroyed. Destroyed targets will be lowered or removed. Attackers may not cross the road until at least one of the siege targets has been destroyed. Attackers may not pass the front edge of the castle in a given area before the siege target for that area has been destroyed. Defenders may leave the castle in an area to harry or harass attackers once the siege target for that area has been destroyed. Defending combat archers and siege may fire on the attacking army as soon as the castle segment beings. Defenders may not cross the road during the castle  segment. Attacking siege engines will be set up across the road from the castle. Defending siege may be set up in the castle during the break. There will be a no-fly zone for CA and siege on the east side of the castle as determined by the marshals. All holds during this battle are general. The clock stops during holds. Start time: 10 am.

There will be a 10-minute reset time between battles. Middle to start on the East side of the field, East to start on the West side of the field. There will be 5 parallel bridges 90 ft long. The center 3 bridges will be 27 feet wide. The outside bridges will be 18 feet wide. Adjoining bridges will be separated by a gap of 18 feet. The center of the bridge will be clearly marked by a bale of hay laid outside each side of the bridge, as well as a center line marked with paint. The marshals will mark a center area the width of the bridge 9 feet to either side of the center line. The bridges will be thought of as spanning a deep gorge that is un­traversable by any means other than the bridges provided. Each side will start 50 feet from the end of the bridges at a line clearly marked by the marshals. Each battle will be 10 minutes in length including holds. All  holds will be local until a breakout occurs. Once a breakout occurs, all holds will be general. Both the 10-minute battle clock and the 2-hour scenario clocks will stop during general holds. At the end of the 10-minute battle clock, all fighters outside the center area of the bridges will be excused. If there are fighters from both sides inside the center area of a bridge, that bridge will be considered contested. If no side holds a majority of bridges, any contested bridges will be fought to the last man by the fighters inside the center area of that bridge. After the 10-minute clock has expired, travel between the bridges is not allowed. The side controlling the most bridges wins that battle. Fighting may take place over the hay bales. No fighter may sit, stand, walk or run on the hay bales. 
A fighter may use the hay bales to regain balance or stop his fall. This means that a fighter touching a bale is not automatically “dead”; however, any fighter using a bale to regain his balance or stop his fall for more than 2 seconds is considered “dead”. If a fighter’s hand, shield, weapon, feet or any weight-­bearing item lands over (i.e., on the outside of) the hay bale, that fighter is “dead” and must leave the battle. Merely brushing up against or using a hay bale as a steadying wall to deter falling is not considered dying. “Dead” fighters are required to leave the area of the bridges. Combat archery and siege is allowed on the center three bridges only. Combat archers may not walk onto any bridge. Siege weapons are allowed to set up within 50 feet of the starting line. Combat archers and siege may not move beyond the outside edges of the second and fourth bridges. Combat archers and siege may not target anything outside of the edges of the second and fourth bridges. Combat archers may fire between the inner three bridges. A downed siege weapon will be flagged and cannot be reused in that battle. Kills by a siege weapon are per the normal conventions of combat for siege weaponry. Combat arrows may not be gleaned during a battle. Siege ammunition may be gleaned and inspected before reuse. Start time: 10:00 am. Time limit: 10 minutes each battle for 2 hours. Ten-minute reset time between battles. Resurrection: No. Combat archery: Yes, center 3 bridges only. Siege: Yes, center 3 bridges only.  ",2.5,"",,,,,1,2016-05-26 13:23:36 -0400,War Point

Five flags will be arrayed unevenly on the field from the south to the north.,"This will be a timed resurrection battle. The field will be approx. 600’ E/W by approx. 600’ N/S. Five flags will be arrayed unevenly on the field from the south to the north such that the distances between each flag decrease progressively. The battle will be run twice, with each side taking the role of attacker and defender sequentially. The side that is behind in total War Points will have the option to choose attack or defense first. If both sides are tied, a coin flip will determine  priority. The attacking resurrection area will be located, initially, at the center of the southernmost  boundary of the field, while the defending resurrection area will be located within the castle. No living individual may enter or leave the castle by any route but the front gate; the dead may enter or leave as they see fit. This gate will be open at the start of the battle, and remain so  throughout.
The attacking side will deploy from their initial res point, while the defending side may deploy anywhere on the field as far forward as the southernmost flag. Each flag can be captured by the attacking team by changing the represented color  appropriately (flipping the hay bale, raising the correct flag, etc.). The flags **must** be captured in order. Once a flag is captured, the attacking team may use that as a resurrection point for the  remainder of the battle. A flag that is captured can not be re-­taken by the defenders.
The battle is over when the northernmost flag is captured. The attackers **do not** need to capture the defenders' resurrection point. If, at the end of 30 minutes, the northernmost flag has not been captured, a hold will be called, and the defenders will be informed that they are no longer resurrecting. All those currently dead **when the hold is called** will be allowed to complete their walk and to resurrect one final time. The attackers will continue to resurrect as normal. Play continues until the northernmost flag is captured.
All holds are general and stop the clock.
The winner is the side that captured the northernmost flag in the least amount of time. 
Start time: 1 pm.  Time limit: 60+ minutes, 2 iterations of ~30 minutes or less. Resurrection: Yes.  DFB: Yes.",2.0,"",,,,,1,2016-05-26 13:27:44 -0400,War Point

Each scenario is allotted 30 minutes.","This battle will consist of three scenarios: archery scenario, siege scenario, and combined scenario. Each scenario is allotted 30 minutes of fighting time. All of the usual heavy armor and weapon requirements apply. In these rules, the term “arrow” includes both arrows and crossbow bolts, and the term “pavise” includes both heavy combat shields and standing pavises.
Combatants: 
There are three types of combatants: Siege engineers/crew, combat archers, and shieldmen. Engineers may target any enemy combatant, under usual siege rules. A siege engine has 3 hit points and takes hits only from other siege engines. Engineers should call out the number of hits the engine has received whenever it is struck. When an engine is destroyed by being struck, it must be removed from battle and made safe. When there are too few surviving engineers to safely fire an engine, that engine is immediately considered destroyed. Ammunition bags or clusters that are struck by opposing siege fire are destroyed for the duration of that scenario. At the start of a scenario, engineers may be at the ready, but engines may **not** be cocked or loaded. Engines may be moved during scenarios. 
Archers may target all the usual heavy weapon target zones (i.e., face, body, and limbs). **Note**: Arrows may **not** be used against siege engineers **until** Scenario 3. 
Tubular arrows and bolts may be gleaned. Siege ammo of all types may be gleaned. Shafted ammo might be re-­inspected during the siege scenario, depending on marshal availability. At the start of a scenario, archers may be at the ready, but bows may **not** be cocked or loaded.
Shieldmen consist of shield carriers and pavise carriers. **No** rattan striking or thrusting weapons are permitted in this battle. **All thrown weapons or objects must be inspected and passed before use. Inspected** thrown weapons (e.g., javelins, including rattan-shafted javelins, axes, maces or ""pork chops"") are permitted, and **must be thrown at a minimum distance of 10 feet**. Hand-­held thrown rocks are **not allowed**.
At no time may shieldmen contact, impede or directly harass opposing combatants, nor approach within 5 yards of a siege engine. Thrown weapons may be used against siege engineers Thrown weapons may be gleaned at any time. All shieldmen must carry **only** one pavise or shield. The pavise must remain with the combatant at all times (even during resurrection). If a pavise is struck by siege ammunition, it is destroyed along with any munitions or weapons stored behind it, and its carrier is dead. Pavises are impervious to arrows. Each side is limited to 30 shieldmen.
Scenario 1: Combat Archery 30­-minute resurrection battle with **no** siege engines. Siege crew and engineers **may** take part in this battle if they are **only** throwing weapons. Victory condition: Control of a majority of buildings when time expires. Set-up: Open field with 5 village buildings. Each building has two doorways, which are on opposite sides. Arrows and thrown weapons must pass through doorways, not walls. Shieldmen may enter buildings, but only **one** may stand in any doorway. All combatants begin the battle along the resurrection line at the edge of the field. Resurrection is unlimited. At the conclusion of the battle, if there are opposing forces within a building, they will fight to the last man without exiting the building. If this engagement is inconclusive after 5 minutes, numerical superiority wins.
Scenario 2: Siege 30­-minute non­-resurrection battle with **no** combat archery Set-up: Open field. Engine position is restricted by a forward line and back line, which will be marked for each side. The forward lines will be ­30­ yards apart, and the back lines will be 25 yards from the front lines. No more than 3 shieldmen are permitted per siege engine. Shieldmen must be 5 yards away from any engine. Shields may be lifted to block shots but fighter and shield are dead. Shieldmen may carry and use thrown objects. Siege crews may carry and throw objects per SCA rules. Destroyed engines must be removed from the field. Living crew or engineers may remain in combat if their engines are destroyed. Victory condition: (1) All opposing engines destroyed. (2) At the end of 30 minutes, the side with fewest destroyed engines wins. (3) In case of a tie, sudden death overtime: All shieldmen are removed and the first hit wins the scenario.
Scenario 3: Combined battle 30-minute non­-resurrection battle. Set-up: Siege may shoot over building walls. Shieldmen may enter buildings. Only **one** shieldman in any doorway. All thrown objects and CA must go through doorways. Siege crews may be struck by thrown objects. Siege crews may throw objects in self defense.
Combat archers **may** shoot at siege crews. Victory conditions: (1) Last man standing . (2) Control of a majority of buildings when time expires. Siege engines are destroyed by 3 siege hits. Destroyed engines must be removed from the field. Living crew or engineers may remain in combat to throw objects if their engines are destroyed. Field: Engine position is restricted by a forward line and back line, which will be marked for each side. The forward lines will be ­30­ yards apart, and the back lines will be 25 yards from the front lines. No more than 3 shieldmen are permitted per siege engine.

This will be a resurrection battle. The field will be 240’ E/W x approx. 500’ N/S. ,"This will be a resurrection battle. The field will be 240’ E/W x approx. 500’ N/S. On the field will  be 15 buildings arrayed in a 3x5 grid. Buildings will be 30’ wide with roughly 30’ between them. Each of the inner 9 buildings will have a 15’ door in its east and west walls, while the outer 6 buildings will not have doors in of any kind.
Each deployment area will be 50 feet in from the edge of the field, mirroring a corner of the  battlefield, running north and south. The deployment areas are across from one ­another and  are roughly 50’ wide. The opposite two corners will have scoring areas designated by hay bales.    
There will be 9 banners each on a 9’ pole placed in each of the center 9 buildings at the start of the battle. A flag can be picked up by anyone on any team. Someone holding a flag may hold a  weapon in their other hand, and fight with that weapon as normal. Someone who is authorized  in rigid parry may use the flag to defend themselves. No one carrying a flag may move faster than a walk. An individual who is killed while holding a flag must crouch at the location where  they died, and announce loudly “dead, dead, dead, etc…” until such a time as the flag is taken from them. Anyone on either team may take the flag, and the dead fighter holding the flag must  relinquish it readily. A fighter may put an extra weapon or defensive object in their non-­flag-­holding hand, or carry the flag while also carrying a weapon or defensive object, but  may not then use that hand to fight or defend.
A side will score a flag by carrying it to the scoring area in the opposite corner of the battlefield from their resurrection point. Flags will be scored immediately upon being collected by a marshal in one of the scoring areas. Marshals will attempt to collect a flag from a flag carrier as quickly as possible after the flag breaks the plane of the scoring area’s border. The first team to score 5 flags wins the war point. If, at the end of 45 minutes, no team has scored 5 flags, the team with the most flags scored will be declared the winner. Should both teams have the same  number of scored flags, there will be 15 minutes of overtime. Should the scores remain the same at the end of that overtime, the scenario will be declared a tie.

Day 5: Feast Entertainment and Heralding:
Feast is one of the first places in the Society where we see bardic performance. It is also one of the most difficult things we do. How does one perform for a feast? What material do you select? Do you perform for the entire hall or go from table to table? How does one sign up to do this? How to co-ordinate it with the feast herald? While heralding feast may not be bardic art, it is certainly a theatrical one - and an office bards are sometimes asked to perform. How does one do it?

Wrapping Up:
What can we improve? What’s missing? What classes do we want to see taught that aren’t? What topics do we want to discuss? How can we make the bardic arts and its class tracks even better?
