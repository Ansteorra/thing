IPA, being an *international* alphabet, is able to transcribe the sounds made by any language at any time period. This is so important to us in our hobby because with one alphabet of symbols we can recreate the sounds of any name from any culture, and as we all learn the symbols together, we can all pronounce the names in a standardized way.

This class focuses on the origins, biological mechanisms, means of transmission and long term impact on the affected populations. When early man lived in relatively isolated groups, contact between individuals was infrequent and short-lived diseases (for either the disease or the host) were not able to spread by direct contact or through intermediaries such as rats, mosquitoes, etc. As people began to live closer together in towns, later in cities, and when sanitation became more of a threat to health, transmission of diseases became easier and more common. Resistant individuals lived and the less-resistant died, thus selectively increasing resistance in the population as a whole. The gradually declining death toll seen in recurrences of a particular plague was due to an increase in resistance within the population due to several factors. Modern medical investigations indicate that the same genetic makeup that allowed some people to survive or avoid bubonic plague are the same genetic makeup that allows some people be HIV positive and not develop AIDS.

This class focuses on the origins, biological mechanisms, means of transmission and long term impact on the affected populations. When early man lived in relatively isolated groups, contact between individuals was infrequent and short-lived diseases (for either the disease or the host) were not able to spread by direct contact or through intermediaries such as rats, mosquitoes, etc. As people began to live closer together in towns, later in cities, and when sanitation became more of a threat to health, transmission of diseases became easier and more common. Resistant individuals lived and the less-resistant died, thus selectively increasing resistance in the population as a whole. The gradually declining death toll seen in recurrences of a particular plague was due to an increase in resistance within the population due to several factors. Modern medical investigations indicate that the same genetic makeup that allowed some people to survive or avoid bubonic plague are the same genetic makeup that allows some people be HIV positive and not develop AIDS.

1) Each letter has to represent a sound.
2) A single sound can not be represented by more than one letter.

The problem is that as a language develops, the rules of the alphabet are broken. This is why IPA (the International Phonetic Alphabet) is such a completely amazing tool that has been used by linguists over the past 100 years.

IPA, being an *international* alphabet, is able to transcribe the sounds made by any language at any time period. This is so important to us in our hobby because with one alphabet of symbols we can recreate the sounds of any name from any culture, and as we all learn the symbols together, we can all pronounce the names in a standardized way. There will be no more questioning, as long as the name is written in these symbols.

This class is a crash course in IPA for anyone interested in pronunciations and language, focused on how helpful it would be in the SCA for heralds, wordsmiths, and performers.",2.0,"",,30,,,2,2014-05-17 12:00:27 -0400

This year’s weapon choice: Iconic weapons of your persona. Please bring to the field that form which best represents your period. 

Participants **must** appear in armour that inspires others to excellence, having no glaringly un-documentable aspects beyond those required for safety, i.e., baskethilts, bargrills, cops, gauntlets, etc. (Rule of thumb: if you can document it, you can have it -- to include kits based on period works of art. If you cannot document it, you must make a reasonable attempt to hide it.)

Participants should be prepared to document their choices in kit.
Guaranteed rejections: 
•	Exposed modern footwear. Period footwear is preferred. All effort must be made to make modern footwear appear as period as possible. 
•	Street hockey gloves **unless** covered or colored to look like real gauntlets or gloves. 
•	Exposed plastic to include plastic lamellar 
•	""Casserole"" armour. Casserole: any mis-mash of time periods, e.g. Churburg breastplate with a Dura helm and Wisby gauntlets, etc. (All these are documentable by themselves, but centuries apart.) 
•	Inappropriate persona/arms combination such as Viking with a heater, great-swording Roman, madu, etc.
•	A t-tunic over football pads or similar look. 
•	Armour in poor condition or disrepair, undyed leather, etc. 
Two winners will be selected. (We ask that entrants or friends of competitors donate prizes for the winners' cache.) 
•	The Tournament Winner (martial prowess) will receive the title ""Fedoratii Primus Pilus"". 
•	The second winner will be chosen from amongst the participants as ""best kit in show"" and receive the title ""Fedoratii Signifer"".
