This class focuses on the origins, biological mechanisms, means of transmission and long term impact on the affected populations. When early man lived in relatively isolated groups, contact between individuals was infrequent and short-lived diseases (for either the disease or the host) were not able to spread by direct contact or through intermediaries such as rats, mosquitoes, etc. As people began to live closer together in towns, later in cities, and when sanitation became more of a threat to health, transmission of diseases became easier and more common. Resistant individuals lived and the less-resistant died, thus selectively increasing resistance in the population as a whole. The gradually declining death toll seen in recurrences of a particular plague was due to an increase in resistance within the population due to several factors. Modern medical investigations indicate that the same genetic makeup that allowed some people to survive or avoid bubonic plague are the same genetic makeup that allows some people be HIV positive and not develop AIDS.

These strings were made with silk finger loop braided lengths made by two braiders working side-by-side. The pair of purse strings were then inserted into the tops of the cloth purses in a special method that avoided the use of a casing.  
We will be hands-on in this class, pairing braiding students up to learn the cooperative braiding method used. While this class is not for beginners, the first 20 minutes will start with a warm-up/refresher of the single braid patterns before pairing braiders together.

Three siege hits will destroy a ballista; six siege hits for a trebuchet or similar type of engine. If the crew number falls below the minimum for operation, the engine cannot be operated until the missing crew person resurrects and returns. Pavises and shields struck by a siege object must be removed from the field as destroyed and may resurrect. If they are struck while being held or moved, the holder is dead (archer or not) and must resurrect.

• All holds are local. Clock **runs** during any hold except medical. No time checks are given.
• Field: The opposing sides will attempt to take each other’s engines out with siege fire. Engines may move and reposition during combat in attempts to evade hits. There will be both a forward line, beyond which engines may not advance, and a back line, beyond which they may not retreat, unless destroyed. The buildings on the field are combat obstacles.
• Victory condition: Numerical engine superiority of one side remaining at 30 minutes. Pavises and shields remaining will not count.
• If the sides are equal at the end of 30 minutes there is a shootout: pavises and shields remaining will be removed. The first engine hit scored by any engine wins the battle for that side.
• Starting State: Siege crews must start behind the back line on the field and get a running start to their engine. Their engine must be in a 'safe' condition and may not be ready to fire, cocked, or have the trigger attached.
• Pavise and shield holders must start onto the field from behind the **forward** line. Siege ammo may be gleaned **only** by engine crews. Siege crews can **not** carry or move pavises or shields.

• Pavise/shield holders **may** use thrown objects (javelins, maces, pork chops, axes) to target the opposing sides pavise/shield holders. They may **not** target siege crews. Thrown objects may be gleaned and reused by any side.
• Three hits by a siege object will destroy a ballista; six hits for a trebuchet. Crews should call out one, two, three… when their siege engine is hit.
• Siege crew members may be struck **only** by siege ammo and are dead. Incoming shots cannot be intentionally blocked by the engine crews. If so, the crew person is dead.  Once the battle starts, crews cannot switch engines. When their engine is destroyed, the crew is dead. When the crew falls below the minimum necessary to operate the engine, the engine and remaining crew members are dead. The buildings on the field are obstacles to siege fire and thrown objects. They may not be fired through to hit another engine or person. Shots made through buildings will not count. Pavises and shields may not be placed inside of any building.
• Engines may not be fired while being moved or while in motion.

","The year 1066 was a turning point in history, and at our Hastings Battle, you will have the chance to rewrite history! The valor and skill of the warriors on each side will determine the outcome.
Choose a side - defend the Saxons, or join attacking Norman forces - and use your strength of arms to help decide the day. This is a special rules melee. We've attempted to make this event a time for fighters to showcase their beautiful mid-period kits in an atmosphere recreating the feel of battles in the 11th century.
Rules:
1) A combatant may count the first strike they receive against mail armor as light.
2) In general, any form of armor that is documentable to the Battle of Hastings period and region is acceptable. If you have specific questions, please ask via email: olafharaldson@gmail.com.
3) General rules: No exposed plastic (plastic gauntlets OK), no exposed duct tape, no exposed modern sports gear, no exposed modern logos, no blatantly modern footwear.
4) Helms: Spangen or conical construction preferred. No closed faced helms of any type, and no blatantly 12th century+ helms.
5) Torso: Anything documentable to the period. Mail has an advantage, but a padded or even plain tunic is documentable as well. We are not forbidding lamellar… but we aren’t encouraging it either. The intent of the battle is to highlight documentable Hastings-age kits. Lamellar will not be given the ability to take the first shot to the body as light.
6) Limb armor: Greaves and vambraces may be exposed, all other limb armor should be hidden. Spaulders must be covered if worn. Body armour should be under your maille or tunic.
7) Gauntlets: Any are acceptable (even plastic); this is a safety factor which supersedes historical practice.
8) Shields: Round or kite only. No later period designs (heater, etc.).
9) Weapons: Primary weapons should be spear, axe, great axe, sword, seax. Thrown weapons (javelins, axes) are OK. Combat archery OK. No weapons that are undocumentable to the place and time.
10) Force commanders require one extra mortal wound to kill. I will be needing a Harald and a William… if you are interested in playing either part, and have a kit you think is appropriate, email olafharaldson@gmail.com .
11) Tape is not used as a marker for sides; fighters will use battle cries to tell friend from foe.
12) Engagement is 360 degrees once ""lay on"" is called. Yes, this means you may be struck from behind.
Victory Conditions:
Best three of five battles. Victory is achieved either by destroying the enemy force, or by killing the enemy leader (routing the force he commands).
Participants are asked to bring some small token as ""loot""; the side losing three of five battles will give someone on the other side their ""loot"" token. This should not be an expensive item, but rather a token of victory on the field that day appropriate to your station.",2.0,"",,,,,1,2015-04-18 14:18:31 -0400

This class focuses on the origins, biological mechanisms, means of transmission and long term impact on the affected populations. When early man lived in relatively isolated groups, contact between individuals was infrequent and short-lived diseases (for either the disease or the host) were not able to spread by direct contact or through intermediaries such as rats, mosquitoes, etc. As people began to live closer together in towns, later in cities, and when sanitation became more of a threat to health, transmission of diseases became easier and more common. Resistant individuals lived and the less-resistant died, thus selectively increasing resistance in the population as a whole. The gradually declining death toll seen in recurrences of a particular plague was due to an increase in resistance within the population due to several factors. Modern medical investigations indicate that the same genetic makeup that allowed some people to survive or avoid bubonic plague are the same genetic makeup that allows some people be HIV positive and not develop AIDS.
