It does *not* include introduction to runes. You may take this workshop without knowing the runes, but you will need to learn them to be able to use this system.

A number #9 *fukusa* is much easier to manipulate than *fukusa* with lower numbers. Paying extra is worth the price. A *fukusa* and a fan are what  you need to practice during class.

There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp.

Format: Timed Battle; at the end of each battle, the bridge flags will be checked; the side with the most flags raised for their color wins the war point for the battle
Setup: 5 bridges with no fording; the bridge lines will be painted on the field prior to Field battle in the morning; we will ask fighters after the field battle to grab one bail and drop it on one of the bridge lines; setup for the bridges should be very quick with that much help available; bridge rules on engagement will be the same as last year.

Control of the bridge is determined by what flag is up at the end of the battle. Bridge Length = 90’, Bridge Width = 27’; distance between bridges 40’ no fording or going around the outer bridges; traditional layout with the bridges facing East/West; each bridge will have a control flag on the north side bridge wall halfway across the bridge (see diagram)
Time Limit: 15 minutes per battle
Number of Run Throughs: 3; 15-minute reset time between Bridge Battles
War Points: 3; each Bridge Battle will be worth 1 War Point for a total of 3 War Points from all Bridge Battles (NON-Traditional – this is a suggested change)
Marshals Required: Middle, East and Aethelmearc must provide at least 8 marshals each in addition to their Earl Marshal to start the battle.

There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do.

description added soon","(or 30 minutes after Rapier Field Battle)
TENTATIVE:
Format: Timed Battle (see additional notes below)
Size of Field: 600’ N-S x 300’ E-W between deployment/resurrection lines, utilizing the fort - only entrance is front gate, dead may exit anywhere
	Obstacles and obstacle placement:
	Size/location of tower: 30’x30’ (approx. 10 haybales), approx. 50’ South from gate of fort
	Doorways: 2 9’ foot doorways, E-W along the line from main fort gate
	Wall: Extending from center of southern wall of tower, in line with fort main gate, 30’ long
	Dispersal of “broken” field: random scattering to south of wall, extending approx. 40’ south, made of sets of three bales making “corners.” Bales are assumed to be trees, and cannot be fought over.
	Deployment points/lines:
	Deployment Lines: ~125 feet in from overall field boundaries.
	Direction of deployment: East/West
	Resurrection points/lines: Same as deployment lines
	Flags
	Number of Flags: Five flags, pulley type - capture is determined by a flag being at the topmost point
	Flag placement: One flag in fort, one in tower, one 60’ south of tower flag - to the south of the wall - in “orchard”, and two in open field to the south of the orchard (60’ apart)
	Non-physical Parameters:
	Resurrection/Non-resurrection:  Resurrection
	Limited/Unlimited:  Unlimited for both sides
	Hold Specifics: Non-medical holds are general and do not stop the clock.  Medical holds are battlefield-wide and stop the clock.
	Number of marshals needed: one marshal provided by each side per nine combatants
	Timing:
	Overall time for scenario:  55-65 minutes (60 minutes +/-5), Majority of flags takes each time check, each time check is worth 1 war point.
	Number of iterations:  1, At the midpoint of the battle (directly after the second time check), a hold will be called and the armies will switch sides of the field, redeploying from their new Rez lines. 10 minute break after switching sides.
	Time check window(s): Two in first “half,” one after side-switch - marshals will meet before battle to choose three times
	War Points: 3;  This entire Rapier scenario is worth 3 War Points

","The year 1066 was a turning point in history, and at our Hastings Battle, you will have the chance to rewrite history! The valor and skill of the warriors on each side will determine the outcome.
Choose a side - defend the Saxons, or join attacking Norman forces - and use your strength of arms to help decide the day. This is a special rules melée. We've attempted to make this event a time for fighters to showcase their beautiful mid-period kits in an atmosphere recreating the feel of battles in the 11th century.
Rules:
1) A combatant may count the first strike they receive against mail armor as light.
2) In general, any form of armor that is documentable to the Battle of Hastings period and region is acceptable. If you have specific questions, please ask via email: olafharaldson@gmail.com.
3) General rules: No exposed plastic (plastic gauntlets OK), no exposed duct tape, no exposed modern sports gear, no exposed modern logos, no blatantly modern footwear.
4) Helms: *Spangen* or conical construction preferred. No closed faced helms of any type, and no blatantly post-12th century helms.
5) Torso: Anything documentable to the period. Mail has an advantage, but a padded or even plain tunic is documentable as well. We are not forbidding lamellar… but is strongly discouraged. The intent of the battle is to highlight documentable Hastings-age kits. Lamellar will not be given the ability to take the first shot to the body as light.
6) Limb armor: Greaves and vambraces may be exposed, all other limb armor should be hidden. Spaulders must be covered if worn. Body armour should be under your maille or tunic.
7) Gauntlets: Any are acceptable (even plastic); this is a safety factor which supersedes historical practice.
8) Shields: Round or kite only. No later period designs (heater, etc.).
9) Weapons: Primary weapons should be spear, axe, great axe, sword, seax. Thrown weapons (javelins, axes) are OK. Combat archery OK. No weapons that are undocumentable to the place and time.
10) Force commanders require one extra mortal wound to kill. I will be needing a Harald and a William… if you are interested in playing either part, and have a kit you think is appropriate, email olafharaldson@gmail.com .
11) Tape is not used as a marker for sides; fighters will use battle cries to tell friend from foe.
12) Engagement is 360 degrees once ""lay on"" is called. Yes, this means you may be struck from behind.
Victory Conditions:
Best three of five battles. Victory is achieved either by destroying the enemy force, or by killing the enemy leader (routing the force he commands).
Participants are asked to bring some small token as ""loot""; the side losing three of five battles will give someone on the other side their ""loot"" token. This should not be an expensive item, but rather a token of victory on the field that day appropriate to your station.",2.0,"",,,,,1,2017-05-06 20:04:58 UTC,Battlefield

In keeping with previous years, the morning will be filled with a variety of arts and crafts, ongoing activities and live performances to amuse and delight.

Parents and Guardians, please note that you must remain with your child at the Fête. Due to the large numbers of children that attend, organizers cannot be responsible for food allergies or other health issue. We ask that children do not bring personal articles with them as the organizers will not be responsible for lost, broken or stolen items and sad faces.
 
Volunteers Needed: Volunteers are always needed for the Fête! We have need of gentles that want to sponsor their own activity or help with activities that need additional people. Gentles are needed to set up and help clean up and also to provide general help (i.e., signing in children, relief staff, etc.). We can never have too many people helping. We ask that volunteers be at The Great Hall at 9 am for set up, and clean up should be done by 2 pm. Please consider giving your time to ensure the children have a magnificent time!

While it is possible to save money by ordering directly from Japan, doing so requires dealing with Japanese online storefronts. A note about *fukusa*. A number #9 *fukusa* is much easier to manipulate than *fukusa* with lower numbers. Paying extra is worth the price. A *fukusa* and a fan are what  you need to practice during class.

There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html (Yes, they really are that expensive.)

For example, there would be 150’ between the southernmost flag and the next, and then 100’ between that flag and the next, etc. As each flag is captured, it becomes the new res point for the attacking army and cannot be recaptured.
Resurrection/Non-resurrection:  Res
Limited/Unlimited:  Unlimited for both sides, until 10 minutes elapse or victory conditions are met.  If at the end of 10 minutes, the attacker has not captured the northernmost flag, the battle will continue with unlimited res for the attacker and NO RES for the defender until the northernmost flag - is captured by the attacker or the defending army has been entirely wiped out.
Victory Condition: Timed.  The attacking side that captures the northernmost flag (not the defending res-point) the fastest, over all iterations, will win.  For each iteration, at the end of 10 minutes if the northernmost flag is not captured, a hold will be called. The clock will be paused, and the marshals will announce the switch to sudden-death.  All defenders that are currently dead and on their way to res may continue to the res point and wait there for the lay-on.  From this point forward, defenders will no longer res. Marshals will un-pause the clocks when the lay-on is called. The side with the shortest overall time for capturing the northernmost flag after all iterations will receive the war point.
Hold specifics: All holds will be general and will stop the clock.
Number of marshals needed:10 marshals provided by each principal kingdom (Mid, East, and Aethelmearc) for a total of 30 marshals. 
Timing
	Overall time for scenario: ~1:10
	Number of iterations: 6, up to 10 minutes each, plus possible “sudden death.” The side with the fewer war points on Thursday evening will decided if they want to be attackers or defenders first. Side A will attack for the first three iterations, then side B will attack for the 4-6th iterations. 
	Time between iterations:  5 minutes
	Time check window(s):  N/A
Point allocation
	One point will be awarded. The side that has had the shortest overall time for capturing the northernmost flag wins the point.
	War Points: 1

Day 5:  These Are Not the Bards You’re Looking For, Move Along:
Some bardic circles are built around specific, over-arching themes: family friendly, bawdy, enchanted ground, etc. Are there ways, other than the Old Jedi Mind Trick, to clue new arrivals in on what sort of circle they’ve arrived at? How do we handle things when someone powerfully breaks the theme (ie, the kids are all awake and this guy is starting in on the Moose Song)?
Confirmed Panelists: THL Aibhilin inghean Daibhidh, Baroness Morgan Wolfsinger.

Wrapping Up:
What can we improve? What’s missing? What classes do we want to see taught that aren’t? What topics do we want to discuss?  How can we make the bardic arts and its class tracks even better?
