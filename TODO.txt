* Private camp locations, 2 per page, with lines to write on

* Class attendance count entry, pull-down for date and time, per location

* Filter classes displayed in track listing (for coordinators) and for
  users making a custom schdedule by date.

* Sort classes displayed in track listing and for users by date, rather than
  class name.

* Allow users to block out time they will NOT want to see any potential
  classes for.

* Allow track coordinators to create some sort of placeholder user, which
  can be used for scheduling.  Also, overridding instances per-instructor
  would be good. These classes might not count against the would-be
  user, and act more like "additional instructors" do now.

* Revamp the topic/culture listings we use.

* Email when a class is added to a user's "watch list" of topics.

* Email when a class is moved to a track, mailing both the winning and
  losing track coordinators.

* Email to instructors when instructor-visible changes occur to a class.
